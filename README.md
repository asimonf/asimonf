- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @asimonf. I currently live in Chile.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things computing. From low-level software development to 
high-level web development and everything. I'm also interested in videogames. 
They were my first contact with this world and it was the reason I wanted to become
a software developer. Even though I don't do much with games professionally, they still
have a place in my heart and I hope one day I'll make a game someone else can enjoy.
Additionally, I love electronics too. So I even like making my own computers from 
scratch. While I have nothing to show for it publicly, maybe I'll share my schematics
and photos of my PCBs one day.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning VHDL and Go. I've been looking to improve my 
ability to make complex circuitry and FPGAs are a great way to step into the 
realm of advanced computing without breaking the bank. Additionally, as a software 
developer, I'm always interested in expanding my toolset for an everchanging landscape.
Since my professional background has been more on the backend side of web development, Go piqued my
interest.

If you want to reach me, this is the best place. I don't frequent social networks much
out in the public and, as of right now, I don't really have a place I share my thoughts online.
So this is it.
